Pseudocode :

Initialize flag and count to 0;
Initialize number to 1;


While count < 10001 //loop until 
    if number = 1
        Not Prime
    if number is EVEN:
        Not Prime
    if number is 2;
        Prime
    
    Take square root of number:
        change to integer

        Check only odd number:
            if flag == 0:
                answer + number
                Increase count
        Increase number
